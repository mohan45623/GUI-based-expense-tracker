# GUI-based-expense-tracker
During academics I and my team Worked on GUI based expense tracker. The main objective of this project is to track the expenses of users . Where they are spending and how much they are spending. By tracking the expenses users can know where they can spend or save. By representing expenses in more interactive ways like pie charts and bar graphs so that  users can understand easily for this we used python libraries like tkinter for the gui frame work like buttons frames . we linked our project with SQL lite for storing expenses of user and maptloid libraries for creating pie charts and bar graphs
